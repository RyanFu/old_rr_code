The script is used to deploy cwf process 

main steps:
step 1: svn up dist_actions dir,because to deploy the lastest version of executable program
step 2: if it's the first time to deploy, the script makes actions dir for exe which is copied from dist_actions dir.
        else it checks exe md5 values between actions dir and dist_actions dir. 
        because the exe in actions dir is not the lastest one in svn, 
        it needs deployer copy the lastest exe from dist_actions dir to actions dir and this script wouldn't do this!
