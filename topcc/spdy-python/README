nbhttp - Tools for building non-blocking HTTP components


* About nbhttp

nbhttp is a set of libraries for building non-blocking (a.k.a. asynchronous
or event-driven) HTTP clients, servers and intermediaries. 

Its aims are to expose full HTTP functionality in a conformant manner, with
the maximum potential for performance.

It is NOT YET SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION USE. In particular, the code has not 
been optimised or benchmarked, nor are there limits on resource usage, logging
or any number of other things that make a practical web server or intermediary
a useful thing.

However, it's lots of fun to prototype and play with.


* Requirements

nbhttp needs Python 2.5 or greater; see <http://python.org/>

Optionally, it will take advantage of the pyevent extension, if installed.
See <http://code.google.com/p/pyevent/>.


* Installation

> python setup.py install


* SUPPORT, REPORTING ISSUES AND CONTRIBUTING
